The InnoChain ETN network is a shared research training environment examining how advances in digital design tools challenge building culture enabling sustainable, informed and materially smart design solutions. The network aims to train a new generation of interdisciplinary researchers with a strong industry focus that can effect real changes in the way we think, design and build our physical environment.

This project has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No 642877.
