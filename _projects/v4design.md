V4Design will develop a platform that provides architects, video game creators and designers of any expertise with innovative tools necessary to enhance and simplify the creative phase of the designing process. The main idea behind V4Design is to reuse visual: movies, documentaries paintings and images from other artwork and  textual content: from textual documentations in films, critics, catalogues, museum guides, and re-purpose it in order in a way that will be useful for architecture and video game designers.
